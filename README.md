# **Async Task Processing with Celery & RabbitMQ** 🚀  

This project is an **asynchronous task processing system** built using **Celery, RabbitMQ, and MongoDB**. It efficiently handles high-throughput message processing with **automatic retries, dead-letter queue (DLQ) handling, and result persistence**.  

## **Key Features**  
✅ **Celery for Task Processing** – Asynchronous task execution with retries and exponential backoff  
✅ **RabbitMQ as Message Broker** – Reliable queue-based message handling  
✅ **MongoDB for Storage** – Stores processed task results efficiently  
✅ **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Handling** – Ensures failed tasks are logged and retried  
✅ **Dockerized Deployment** – Easily deployable via Docker and Docker Compose  
✅ **Scalability** – Supports high concurrency and parallel processing  

## **Project Structure**  
```
/project-root  
│── celery_app.py        # Celery configuration and initialization  
│── tasks.py             # Task processing logic  
│── dlq_consumer.py      # Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) handling  
│── database.py          # MongoDB connection with pooling  
│── publisher.py         # Publishes messages to RabbitMQ  
│── Dockerfile           # Containerization setup  
│── docker-compose.yml   # Multi-service deployment  
│── .env                 # Environment variables  
```

## **How It Works**  
1️⃣ External apps push **JSON messages** to `task_queue` in RabbitMQ  
2️⃣ Celery **workers** pick up tasks asynchronously and process them  
3️⃣ Processed results are **stored in MongoDB**  
4️⃣ If a task **fails after retries**, it is sent to the **DLQ** for reprocessing  
5️⃣ DLQ consumer picks up failed messages and retries them  

## **Installation & Running**  
### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git  
cd your-repo
```
### **2. Set Up Environment Variables**  
Create a `.env` file with the required configurations (RabbitMQ, MongoDB, etc.).  

### **3. Run the Application with Docker**  
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

### **4. Publish a Task**  
```python
from publisher import publish_message  
publish_message("task_queue", {"task": "process_data", "data": "example"})
```

### **5. Monitor Celery Worker**  
```sh
celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info --queues=celery --concurrency=4
```
